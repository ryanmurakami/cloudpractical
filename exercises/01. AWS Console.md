**Look at Service Dashboards**
  - There are four ways you can navigate to service dashboards
    - Click a link on the front page under the "All Services" expandable section
    - Search in the search box on the front page
    - Click the "Services" top menu option and click a service link
    - Click the "Services" top menu option and search for a service

**Change Regions**
  - Click on the region menu option in the top right
    - The menu option text will be whichever region you are currently in (eg. "N. Virginia")
  - Select another region
    - You will stay in the same location in the AWS console after switching the region
